Installation of archlinux is rather simple and straightforward task. You have control over every important aspect, and you are less likely to face some "magical" problems.

Post install process is more challenging, due to do it once nature. Last time I've reinstalled Arch from scratch was about 5-6y ago. I don't remember what I've changed in the system from that time. Bellow is my log of what I've done this time. I'll (at least try) update it with all steps necessary to bring back all features I previously got. This is my personal setup that works with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/undg/.dot).

## Easy part, no brainer
* Download latest iso from https://archlinux.org/
* Burn iso on pen with https://etcher.balena.io/
* boot from pendrive
* Prepare one clean partition with `fdisk` or any other utility of your choice. I'm choosing whole 250gb drive. It's overkill, but large padding of free space, have drive health benefits.
* https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/archinstall or do it manually following https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide . With archinstall, you can save all steps, and use them later with `archinstall --config` flag.
* For audio pipewire looks like solid solution. Don't forget about pipewire-pulse adapter in post install.
* If you have `home` on separate partition, ignore it for now. It can be mounted in post install.
* Finish installation.

## Post installation
* `chroot` to new system while still in live iso.
* Install few packages. Some of the can be in aur. I like `yay` as as `pacman` wrapper with aur support.
* Install `yay` (bin version compiled on gh-actions, you can compile it yourself if)

```bash
pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
```

#### Edit `/etc/pacman.conf`

If you want to enable testing repo's enable all of them (including mesa-git for AMD gpu)

```confini
# Misc options
UseSyslog
Color
CheckSpace
VerbosePkgLists
ParallelDownloads = 12
DisableDownloadTimeout
ILoveCandy

# (...)
# The testing repositories are disabled by default. To enable, uncomment the
# repo name header and Include lines. You can add preferred servers immediately
# after the header, and they will be used before the default mirrors.

#[core-testing]
#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist


[core]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

#[extra-testing]
#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[extra]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# If you want to run 32 bit applications on your x86_64 system,
# enable the multilib repositories as required here.

#[multilib-testing]
#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# Maintainer: [Laurent Carlier](https://archlinux.org/people/trusted-users/#lcarlier)
# Description: Mesa git builds for the testing repositories
#[mesa-git]
#Server = https://pkgbuild.com/~lcarlier/$repo/$arch

#### I have home in separate partition and cloned drive:
* Remove content of current `home` directory (small temporary backup is always good practice, for fresh install not necessary and if you know what you doing).
* Mount partition with your `old home partition` to current one. Save it in `/ets/fstab`. For me it was just copy paste fstab from old os to new (backup with rsync FTW). Don't forgotten that uuids for recreated partitions will change. If you are using disk location (sda1, sdb1, nvme0n1, ...), they need to be connected to same sockets in motherboard. `lsblk` is your friend to check that, `sudo fdisk -l` if you need more info (including uuids), another option is `blkid`, and my favorite `ls -lha /dev/disk/by-uuid`.
* If you have separate partitions for var, log, whatever, repeat that process.
* Enjoy your fresh install for another couple of years.

#### Iriun webcam for Linux
I cant justify buying crappy webcam, when I have good one in my phone.

```bash
yay iriunwebcam-bin

# install and enable kernel module

sudo pacman -S linux-headers v4l2loopback-dkms
modprobe v4l2loopback
sudo rmmod v4l2loopback; sudo modprobe v4l2loopback
```

#### NetworkManager

`networkctl` (from `systemd-networkd.service`) is perfectly fine for server configuration. For desktop experience thought, we want to use `NetworkManager` that can be used by few gui tools. Most important for me is system tray icon with network status.

Make sure that you have installed:

```bash
networkmanager
network-manager-applet
```

Stop and disable systemd-networkd service, then enable and start service from NetworkManager. Never run them both running in the same time.

```bash
sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd.service
sudo systemctl stop systemd-networkd.service

sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
```

Run `nm-applet` for tray icon, or `nmcli help` for more user friendly experience üòÅ.

#### sshd

Make sure that `openssh` is installed, enabled and started in systed.

Find `Port=22` and change to whatever is not standard.

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

#### Solve screen tearing

Install composite manager and play with vsync. My choice is `picom`, [config is in dotfiles](https://github.com/undg/.dot/blob/master/vm/.config/picom.conf)

#### Steam
Enable multilib in `/etc/pacman.conf`, sync pacman and install Steam

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/pacman.conf
```

```confini
[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

```bash
sudo pacman -Suy
sudo pacman -S steam
```

#### OC and performance

Install `lm_sensors`, for reading temperature run command `sensors`. More on https://hwmon.wiki.kernel.org/faq?s%5b%5d=lm_sensors and https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/lm_sensors

#### Todo:
* [x] home on separate partition
* [x] phone webcam
* [x] network
* [x] ssh
* [x] screen tearing
* [x] temperature monitor utility
    * [x] test performance of GPU
    * [x] test CPU performance
* [x] Steam
* [ ] Blizzard
* [ ] VM-box
