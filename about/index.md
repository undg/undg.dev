**Hey there! I'm Bartek.**

At 40'ish, I'm a chill software engineer who loves to code, innovate, and get my hands dirty with the latest in tech. I tackle complex web applications using a mix of TypeScript, React/Next.js, and a bunch of testing tools like Mocha/Chai and Vitest. I'm all about readable code and robust solutions, and I thrive on the challenges that come with a complicated codebase.

My journey in tech includes stints at Ä€rahi Ltd, Cognizant, Vista Entertainment Solutions, and Keepthinking. At Cognizant, I played a key role in integrating the GOV Design System with PEGA for HMRC, and refactoring Premierinn's payment system. Throughout these roles, I've led projects and championed best practices in coding and test automation.

I'm a seasoned Linux user, which gives me an edge in server management and script automation. I use Arch BTW :-)

Outside of work, I'm either longboarding through London's streets or diving into a 3D printing project. My YouTube channel captures my longboarding adventures, featuring long, uncut videos that showcase the city's vibe. My 3D printing and DIY projects are all about bringing creative ideas to life.
